# To Do

## Soon
[ ] Procedure to create a soft table stub. PK and then FK with constraint to core's PK. Should take a name for the table as argument, nothing else. Not *needed* to make soft tables, but more of a bootstrap guide. Can be used directly and then modified, or the code examined, copied, and modified. Make sure to document the query directly *as well* as the regular documentation, as there is an expectation of modification of the query

## Much later
